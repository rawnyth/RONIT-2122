Cloud computing is a technology paradigm that involves delivering computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and data centers, users and organizations can access and use computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
